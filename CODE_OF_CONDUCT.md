## Responsibilities of Project Maintainers

Maintainers are tasked with defining and upholding standards for acceptable behavior. They are responsible for addressing violations of these standards fairly and appropriately. This includes the authority to modify, remove, or reject contributions such as comments, commits, code, wiki edits, or issues that do not align with this Code of Conduct. Maintainers may also suspend or permanently ban contributors whose behavior is deemed inappropriate, harmful, threatening, or offensive.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and any public settings where individuals are representing the project or its community. Representation includes actions such as using an official project email address, posting through an official social media account, or serving as a designated representative at events, whether online or offline. Project maintainers may provide additional clarification on what constitutes representation.

## Enforcement

Unacceptable behavior, including harassment or abuse, can be reported by contacting the project team. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and responses will be tailored to the specific situation. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality regarding the identity of the individual reporting an incident. Additional enforcement policies may be outlined separately.

Maintainers who fail to enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face disciplinary actions, including suspension or removal, as determined by the project leadership team.
